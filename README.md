# 🔊 Spatial Audio Snippet Collection for Art Students

A curated collection of **spatial audio snippets**, **Ableton Live projects**, and **Max/MSP patches** designed for **art students**, **sound designers**, and **immersive media artists**.  

This repository is your playground for learning and experimenting with **3D sound**, **ambisonics**, and **interactive spatial environments** — from basic panning concepts to full-blown multichannel installations.

## ✨ What’s Inside

Each snippet or project demonstrates a specific technique, setup, or creative approach.  
You can use them as learning tools, building blocks for installations, or templates for performance projects.
